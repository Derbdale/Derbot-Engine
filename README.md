Derbot Engine
======================
My D-Language game engine thing developed for Ludum Dare.

Build Setup

You will need:
* [D language](http://dlang.org/download.html)
* [DUB Package Manager](http://code.dlang.org/download)

Build Instructions
======================
To build the debug version, open a command window and type `dub build` or `dub build -c=Debug`.

To build the release version, open a command window and type `dub build -c=Release`.

To build and run type `dub run` instead of `dub build`.
